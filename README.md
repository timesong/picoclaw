> **PicoClaw** is an independent open-source project initiated by [Sipeed](https://sipeed.com). It is written entirely in **Go** — not a fork of OpenClaw, NanoBot, or any other project.

🦐 PicoClaw is an ultra-lightweight personal AI Assistant inspired by [NanoBot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot), refactored from the ground up in Go through a self-bootstrapping process, where the AI agent itself drove the entire architectural migration and code optimization.

⚡️ Runs on $10 hardware with <10MB RAM: That's 99% less memory than OpenClaw and 98% cheaper than a Mac mini!

> * **Warning:** picoclaw is in early development now and may have unresolved network security issues. Do not deploy to production environments before the v1.0 release.
> * **Note:** picoclaw has recently merged a lot of PRs, which may result in a larger memory footprint (10–20MB) in the latest versions. We plan to prioritize resource optimization as soon as the current feature set reaches a stable state.

## ✨ Features

🪶 **Ultra-Lightweight**: <10MB Memory footprint — 99% smaller than OpenClaw core functionality.*

💰 **Minimal Cost**: Efficient enough to run on $10 Hardware — 98% cheaper than a Mac mini.

⚡️ **Lightning Fast**: 400X Faster startup time, boot in <1 second even on 0.6GHz single core.

🌍 **True Portability**: Single self-contained binary across RISC-V, ARM, MIPS, and x86, One-click to Go!

🤖 **AI-Bootstrapped**: Autonomous Go-native implementation — 95% Agent-generated core with human-in-the-loop refinement.

🔌 **MCP Support**: Native [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) integration — connect any MCP server to extend agent capabilities.

👁️ **Vision Pipeline**: Send images and files directly to the agent — automatic base64 encoding for multimodal LLMs.

🧠 **Smart Routing**: Rule-based model routing — simple queries go to lightweight models, saving API costs.

_*Recent versions may use 10–20MB due to rapid feature merges. Resource optimization is planned. Startup comparison based on 0.8GHz single-core benchmarks (see table below)._

### Install from source (latest features, recommended for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw.git

cd picoclaw
make deps

# Build, no need to install
make build

# Build for multiple platforms
make build-all
